üìö Teacher-Student Interaction Platform
Empowering Education Through Seamless Connection

Welcome to the Teacher-Student Interaction Platform! This project aims to revolutionize the educational experience by providing a robust, secure, and intuitive environment for teachers and students to connect, collaborate, and learn. From assignment management to real-time communication, our platform is designed to foster a dynamic and engaging learning community.
‚ú® Features

    User Authentication & Authorization: Secure login and role-based access for teachers and students.

    Assignment Management: Teachers can create, assign, and grade assignments; students can submit and track their progress.

    Real-time Messaging: Instant communication channels for direct messages and group discussions.

    Resource Sharing: Easily share documents, links, and other learning materials.

    Notifications: Stay updated with important announcements, deadlines, and feedback.

    Responsive Design: Seamless experience across all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) thanks to Tailwind CSS.

    Robust API: A secure and scalable Node.js backend to power all interactions.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

Our platform is built with a modern stack, leveraging the best tools for performance, scalability, and developer experience.
Frontend

    React: A declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

        React Official Documentation

    TypeScript: A strongly typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, enhancing code quality and maintainability.

Backend

    Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

    Express.js: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.

    Database (e.g., MongoDB): (Assuming you use one, adjust if different) A powerful, open-source object-relational database system.

üîí Cybersecurity Protected

Security is paramount. Our platform incorporates several best practices to ensure the safety and privacy of user data:

    JWT (JSON Web Token) Authentication: Secure, stateless authentication for API requests.

    Password Hashing: Passwords are never stored in plain text; bcrypt or similar algorithms are used for hashing.

    Input Validation: All user inputs are rigorously validated on both the client and server sides to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).

    CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) Protection: Configured to allow requests only from trusted origins.

    HTTPS: (Recommend for deployment) Encrypted communication to protect data in transit.

    Environment Variables: Sensitive configurations are managed through environment variables, not hardcoded.

üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your development environment up and running.
Prerequisites

    Node.js (LTS version recommended)

    npm or Yarn (npm is used in examples)

    A database instance (e.g., MongoDB)

Installation

    Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name


    Install backend dependencies:

    cd backend
    npm install


    Install frontend dependencies:

    cd ../frontend
    npm install


Configuration

    Backend Environment Variables:
    Create a .env file in the backend directory based on .env.example (if provided) and fill in your database credentials, JWT secret, etc.

    # backend/.env
    PORT=5000
    DATABASE_URL="mongodb://user:password@host:port/database"
    JWT_SECRET="your_jwt_secret_key"


    Frontend Environment Variables:
    Create a .env file in the frontend directory based on .env.example (if provided) to specify your backend API URL.

    # frontend/.env
    REACT_APP_API_URL="http://localhost:5000/api"


Running the Project

    Start the backend server:

    cd backend
    npm start


    The backend server will typically run on http://localhost:5000.

    Start the frontend development server:

    cd ../frontend
    npm start


    The frontend application will open in your browser, usually at http://localhost:3000.

üí° Usage

    Teachers: Sign up, create courses, add students, publish assignments, and communicate with your classes.

    Students: Join courses, view assignments, submit your work, and interact with teachers and peers.
